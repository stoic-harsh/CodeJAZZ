## Tech/framework used and Pre-requisites
* Next.js
* Material UI
* Tailwindcss
* Monaco Code-Editor
* Judge0 Code-Executioner
* Websockets
* Ably SDK and APIs

## What I learnt
1. Integration of syntax-highlighter and code-editor web components like [CodeMirror](https://codemirror.net/) and [Monaco](https://microsoft.github.io/monaco-editor/).
2. Online code execution systems like [Judge0](https://judge0.com/)
3. Implementing websockets.
4. Implementing real-time functionalities in server-less frameworks like Next.js where websockets don't work.
5. How to use APIs to achieve real-time communication like [Ably](https://ably.com/)

## Usage
Create a ```.env``` file. Place in your RAPID_API_KEY(for judge0 API) and ABLY_API_KEY_ROOT(for Ably). Hit ***npm run dev*** at root location in terminal to start application in localhost. 
Then, you can play around with frontend components and API calls.
